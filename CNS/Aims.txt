CNS Prac3:

AIM:
To implement algo for real world applications to ensure confidentiality, integrity and authenticity of data.

Objective1:(3a): 
Implement Euclid and extended Euclid algo to compute the GCD of two integers. Extended Euclid algo not only
computes gcd of two integers but also finds the coefficient of Bezout's Identity Integers.

Objective2:(3b):
Implement Hill cipher method to encrypt and derypt the financial data during the transmission.
the tech should be able to handle large amount of data efficiently and should be resistant to cryptanalysis 
and interception by unauthorised users.
